# R504 - Store Stock

Welcome to the R504 Store Stock project, a compact yet comprehensive solution designed to facilitate seamless interactions between different components of an e-commerce platform. This project is the culmination of a focused computer science initiative based in Nantes, aiming to demonstrate the power of interconnected APIs in managing store operations efficiently.

## Overview

The R504 Store Stock project encompasses three primary Java REST APIs, each tailored to handle specific aspects of the e-commerce platform:

1. **UserApi**: Manages user-related operations, including authentication, profile management, and user preferences.
2. **PanierApi (BasketApi)**: Handles all functionalities related to the shopping basket, such as item additions, quantity adjustments, and basket summaries.
3. **ArticleApi (ProductApi)**: Dedicated to product management, this API facilitates product listings, detailed product information, and inventory status.

Each API is equipped with comprehensive Swagger UI documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with the available endpoints.

## Swagger UI Access

To explore the capabilities and endpoints offered by each API, you can access their Swagger UI documentation through the following links:

- **UserApi**: http://localhost:8081/userapi/swagger-ui/index.html
- **PanierApi (BasketApi)**: http://localhost:8082/panierapi/swagger-ui/index.html
- **ArticleApi (ProductApi)**: http://localhost:8083/articleapi/swagger-ui/index.html

## Current Status

As of now, the project is fully operational with all endpoints functioning as per the specifications. Here are some highlights:

- **Fully Functional Routes**: Every API endpoint has been thoroughly tested and confirmed to meet the project's requirements.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed logging has been implemented across all components, ensuring transparency and ease of troubleshooting.
- **Extensive Testing**: Rigorous tests have been conducted to ensure the reliability and stability of the APIs.

## Project Insights

This project was a small study project during our last year of study at IUT of Nantes
